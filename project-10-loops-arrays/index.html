    <h2>let vs. const: The Date Scenario</h2>
    <p>
      I replaced the invidual const and let assignments with this after doing
      some independant research into the best usage of the two operators.
    </p>
    <p>
      The choice between <strong>let</strong> and <strong>const</strong> depends
      on whether the variable's value needs to be reassigned. For a date, this
      distinction is crucial.
    </p>
    <h3>When to use const</h3>
    <p>The below example is for logging when a user signed in</p>
    <button onclick="useConstDate()">fixed timestamp</button>
    <p id="const-date-output"></p>
    <h3>When to use let</h3>
    <p>
      The below example is a mini version of a counter tracking how long a user
      has been logged in.
    </p>
    <button onclick="useLetDate()">updating timestamp</button>
    <p id="let-date-output"></p>

    <h2>RETURN STATEMENT CHALLENGE</h2>
    <p>A function is declared to <strong>return</strong> a + b</p>
    <p>
      Another function is declared to give a value to a(5) and b(7) then dispaly
      the result of the new value of a + b.
    </p>
    <button onclick="returnExample()">Click for Result</button>
    <p id="return-output"></p>

    <h2>OBJECT ASSIGNMENT</h2>
    <p>
      "I created a car object. It was given the key names make:, model:, year:
      and color: and the values "Dodge", "Viper", 2021, "red", all respectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within the car object's block, I created a method named description. This
      method is a property with a function as its value. This function returns a
      string that is a combination of the car's property values (make, model,
      year, color). It uses the "this" keyword to reference the object's
      properties and the "+" operator to combine them into a single string.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, I created a separate function that calls this method. When you click
      the button, this function executes, and the method's returned string is
      then displayed on the page.
    </p>
    <button onclick="Car_Function()">Click to display car object.</button>
    <p id="Car_Object"></p>

    <h2>BREAK AND CONTINUE CHALLENGE</h2>
    <h3>Break Statement</h3>
    <p>
      The `break` statement is used to immediately exit a loop. In the below
      example, a loop is set to count from 0 to 9, but the code is instructed to
      "break" when the number 5 is reached. Clicking the button will show that
      the loop stops at 4 and does not continue to 5.
    </p>
    <button onclick="breakLoop()">Run Break Loop</button>
    <p id="break-output"></p>

    <h3>Continue Statement</h3>
    <p>
      The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop
      and move on to the next one. In the below example, a loop is set to count
      from 0 to 9, but the code is instructed to "continue" when the number 5 is
      reached. Clicking the button will show that the number 5 is skipped, and
      the loop continues to the end.
    </p>
    <button onclick="continueLoop()">Run Continue Loop</button>
    <p id="continue-output"></p>
