        Check ouy this fade-in effect on the below paragraph using pure CSS
        animation.

      <p style="animation: fadeIn 3s ease-in-out forwards">
        This text will fade in as the page loads.
      </p>

          Best Practices (Animation Fill-Mode): Correctly used the forwards
          value in my animation property (animation: fadeIn 3s ease-in-out
          forwards). This is best practice for fade-ins because it ensures the
          element stays visible (at the to state of opacity: 1) after the
          animation is complete. Without forwards, the element would snap back
          to the initial state (opacity: 0).
        </li>
        <li>
          Modernization (Performance): Animating the opacity property is highly
          performant because it uses the GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) for
          composition, making the animation smooth. In contrast, animating
          layout properties like width or height forces the browser to
          recalculate the entire page layout on every frame, which is much
          slower.
        </li>
        <li>
          Enhanced Learning (User Experience - UX): The fade-in effect is a
          powerful UX tool. It avoids the jarring experience of elements
          instantly appearing on the page, instead guiding the user's eye and
          creating a sense of modernity and polish. This is crucial for my UI/UX
          Designer Boot Camp focus.
