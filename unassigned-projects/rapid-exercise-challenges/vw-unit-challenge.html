      <h1>Set the font size using the vw unit.</h1>
      <p style="color: blue; font-size: 2vw">
        Font size of this paragraph is set using inline styling. The text size
        is now directly relative to the width of the browser window. If the
        viewport is 1000px wide, 2vw equals 20px. If the viewport shrinks to
        500px, 2vw shrinks to 10px.
      </p>

          Best Practices (Separation of Concerns): While using inline styling
          (style="...") is fast for these challenges, best practice for real
          projects is to use an external linked CSS file or a style block in the
          head of your HTML. This keeps the presentation (style) separate from
          the structure (HTML).

        <li>
          Modernization (Other Viewport Units): In modern CSS, you have four
          primary viewport units:
          <ul>
            <li>vw (Viewport Width): 1vw is 1% of the viewport width.</li>
            <li>vh (Viewport Height): 1vh is 1% of the viewport height.</li>
            <li>
              vmin (Viewport Minimum): 1% of the smaller dimension (width or
              height).
            </li>
            <li>
              vmax (Viewport Maximum): 1% of the larger dimension (width or
              height).
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Enhanced Learning (Responsive UX): The vw unit is fundamental to
          Responsive Design. By making font sizes and element dimensions
          relative to the viewport, you ensure the content scales fluidly and
          provides a consistent User Experience (UX) across devices of vastly
          different screen sizes, from mobile phones to large desktop monitors.
