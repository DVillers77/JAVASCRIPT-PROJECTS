### Assignment Log

#### **Step 32: Repository Creation and Submission**

- **Date**: September 17, 2025
- **Objective**: Successfully created a new GitHub repository named `JAVASCRIPT-PROJECTS` to serve as a central location for all course-related coding assignments and projects.
- **Outcome**: Initialized the repository with a `README.md` file, providing a foundational document for tracking project progress and key learning milestones. This step is crucial for building an online portfolio and demonstrating proficiency with Git and GitHub.

#### **Step 37: Folder Structure & Hello, World! Program**

- **Date**: September 18, 2025
- **Objective**: Establish a clean and logical folder structure for projects and write the first JavaScript program.
- **Outcome**: Successfully created a `project-1-expressions-alert` folder within `Basic JavaScript Projects` and created an `index.html` file inside it. The file contains a working `alert()` method that demonstrates the basic execution of a JavaScript script embedded in an HTML document.

#### **Step 39: Linking JavaScript Files**

- **Date**: September 18, 2025
- **Objective**: To move JavaScript code to an external file and link it to an HTML document.
- **Outcome**: Successfully created a `main.js` file within a dedicated `js` folder and linked it to `index.html` using the `<script>` tag with a `src` attribute. This demonstrated the best practice of separating JavaScript from HTML and the importance of correct file paths.

#### **Step 41: The window.alert() Method**

- **Date**: September 18, 2025
- **Objective**: To demonstrate understanding of the global window object by using the window.alert() method.
- **Outcome**: Successfully modified the `main.js` file to use `window.alert("Hello, world!")`, confirming that `alert()` is a property of the global `window` object and that both methods produce the same result.

#### **Step 43: The document.write() Method Assignment**

- **Date**: September 18, 2025
- **Objective**: To replace the `window.alert()` method with the `document.write()` method to display text directly on the webpage.
- **Outcome**: Successfully modified `main.js` to use `document.write('Hello, world!')`, demonstrating an understanding of how to directly write content to the HTML document.

#### **Step 47: Variables and Operators Assignment**

- **Date**: September 18, 2025
- **Objective**: To practice variable declaration and assignment using the `document.write()` method.
- **Outcome**: Successfully created a variable and displayed its string value on the webpage, demonstrating an understanding of a core JavaScript concept.
