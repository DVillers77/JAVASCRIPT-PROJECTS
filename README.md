### Assignment Log

#### **Step 32: Repository Creation and Submission**

- **Date**: September 17, 2025
- **Objective**: Successfully created a new GitHub repository named `JAVASCRIPT-PROJECTS` to serve as a central location for all course-related coding assignments and projects.
- **Outcome**: Initialized the repository with a `README.md` file, providing a foundational document for tracking project progress and key learning milestones. This step is crucial for building an online portfolio and demonstrating proficiency with Git and GitHub.

#### **Step 37: Folder Structure & Hello, World! Program**

- **Date**: September 18, 2025
- **Objective**: Establish a clean and logical folder structure for projects and write the first JavaScript program.
- **Outcome**: Successfully created a `project-1-expressions-alert` folder within `Basic JavaScript Projects` and created an `index.html` file inside it. The file contains a working `alert()` method that demonstrates the basic execution of a JavaScript script embedded in an HTML document.

#### **Step 39: Linking JavaScript Files**

- **Date**: September 18, 2025
- **Objective**: To move JavaScript code to an external file and link it to an HTML document.
- **Outcome**: Successfully created a `main.js` file within a dedicated `js` folder and linked it to `index.html` using the `<script>` tag with a `src` attribute. This demonstrated the best practice of separating JavaScript from HTML and the importance of correct file paths.
